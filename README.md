# Belly Button Biodiversity

Rosa and I have completed a panel for demographic information with visualizations of the bacterial data for each volunteer. The volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons by selecting their unique Subject ID on the Dashboard. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

The interactive Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard can be found by clicking here: [Belly Button Dashboard](https://kcav18.github.io/BellyButton_Dashboard/).
